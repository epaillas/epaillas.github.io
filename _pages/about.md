I am an astronomer and cosmologist, currently working as a Postdoctoral Associate at the University of Arizona, where I also hold the Prize Fellowship in Cosmological Data Analysis at [Steward Observatory](https://astro.arizona.edu). My research focuses on observational cosmology, combining theory and observations to learn about the nature of dark energy, the growth of cosmic structure, the physics of the early Universe, and the connection between dark matter halos and galaxies.

I grew up in Santiago de Chile, where I obtained my PhD in astrophysics from [Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica de Chile](https://www.uc.cl), working under the supervision of [Nelson Padilla](https://iate.oac.uncor.edu/en/staff-members/2544/). Before moving to Arizona, I worked as a postdoctoral fellow at the [Waterloo Centre for Astrophysics](https://uwaterloo.ca/astrophysics-centre/), in Ontario, Canada, where I collaborated with [Will Percival](https://uwaterloo.ca/physics-astronomy/profile/wperciva) on various topics of large-scale structure science.

I am an active member of the [Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument](https://www.desi.lbl.gov) Collaboration, where I co-chair the Galaxy & Quasar Clustering working group. I have also participated in the [Euclid Consortium](https://www.euclid-ec.org) and the [LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration](https://lsstdesc.org).
